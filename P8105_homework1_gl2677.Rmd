# Problem 1

Here is a **code chunk** that creates the data frame comprised of:

*   A random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
*   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
*   A character vector of length 8
*   A factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r data_frame, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
sample = rnorm(8)
df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = sample,
  vec_logical = sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("My","name","is","Gaotong","LIU","MS","Biostatistic","T & M"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("High","Low","Medium","High","High","Low","Medium","Low"))
  )
```
